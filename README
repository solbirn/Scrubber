About
------
Scrubber in a (quickly thrown together) C# application which will clean your Jump Lists, MRUs (Windows autocomplete entries), and "Recent Files" lists from various programs.
Compiled with VS 2012 for .NET Framework 4.

Notes: It will *not* delete your jump list, just clean the specific unwanted entries. ClickOnce publishing works.

It is licensed under GPL v2. A copy of the license is included in this repository (see files: LICENSE and COPYING).

Requirements
-------------
Windows + .NET Framework.
It is assembled for .NET Framework 4.0, but it should work fine with versions 3.x-4.x, assuming you change the target framework and recompile...

Run
----
Run scrubber.exe, it will prompt you for keyword the first time it is run. Keyword encryption is not coded yet.
Run "scrubber.exe -s" for only the settings window. You will need this if you enable "AutoClose" and want to change a settings.
Keywords are case-sensitive.
You can append keywords as arguments, if you do not wish to save them. (i.e. scrubber.exe private Private personal Personal)
You can also add keywords to %appdata%\Scrubber\scrubber.kw with "|" as a seperator. (i.e. private|Private|personal|Personal)

TODO
-----
-Add encryption for keywords
-Regex support
-CLI for settings
-Proper error-handling/logging
-More MRU/Recent Files clean up locations
-Option to choose what to clean
-General Code Cleanup
